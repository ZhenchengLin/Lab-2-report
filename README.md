Reading the implementation, I notice that this code will not add all numbers thats equals to the lowest number which is buggy. Later I added a checker to clear the bug.

## Part Three
I have learn using assertEquals in cse 12 but I have learn many new stuff!!  
One importent thing I think it is extramly important is the use of Git hub.  
Another stuff that I think is also important is the skills of making webs.
